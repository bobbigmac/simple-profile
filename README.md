# Simple profile

Simple site to create and present a professional portfolio/profile from lists of links showing developed/designed products.

This site is single-user only. The first user to signup is deemed the admin and can create lists, links, and upload images. Any futher registered users may only add comments to each link. The site owner has full permission to edit any content, everyone else may only view all content, or edit their own comments.

To run your version, clone (I suggest forking it first) then deploy to `yourname.meteor.com` (or setup your own domain wherever). You may change the theme easily by adding a different bootstrap theme package. I recommend any of the existing [bootswatch packages on atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/?q=bootswatch%3A).
